 Fraud detection is a critical aspect of securing financial systems and protecting against
 fraudulent activities. This paper introduces a novel approach for fraud detection that
 combines quantum-inspired feature engineering and neural network modeling to achieve
 superior classification accuracy. Utilizing QuantumCircuit from Qiskit, the approach
 encodes input features into quantum states, improving the data representation and
 capturing complex feature interactions. The method employs a Quantum Neural Net
work (QNN) for classifying records and effectively identifying fraudulent transactions.
 Through real-world dataset experiments, we demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed ap
proach, achieving high precision and recall rates while minimizing false positives. This
 research leverages advanced machine learning techniques, including balanced sampling
 strategies to address class imbalance and hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV
 for optimal model performance. The paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of the
 approach, highlighting its strengths in adapting to dynamic and complex environments.
 Quantum-inspired methods offer the potential to significantly enhance fraud detection
 systems, but challenges such as computational complexity and resource requirements
 remain areas for further investigation. In conclusion, our work showcases the promising
 application of quantum-enhanced machine learning in fraud detection. This innovative
 approach opens new avenues for developing advanced detection systems that can effec
tively address the evolving nature of fraudulent activities. Future research may focus
 on refining these methods and exploring their applicability in other domains to further
 expand the benefits of quantum computing in machine learning
